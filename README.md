# perspectiveCorrection

This is the perspective api from google. The original wrap up PYPI project done by Conway (https://github.com/Conway/perspective). I just corrected it with an __init__.py file
Any one can use this library by donwloading it and dumping it in the Lib/sitepackage of python directory.
